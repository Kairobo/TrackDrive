# Track Driving Simulator in MATLAB
 * This simulator is intended for developing algorithms for autonomous cars. 
 * Can be easily tuned to implement reinforcement learning or inverse reinforcement learning algorithms. 
 * For example, it was used for implementing an imitation learning algorithm named [density matching reward learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.03694).

## Track Driving Simulation
 * The blue car is controlled by the keyboard and the red cars autonomously maintain each lanes.

## Main Features
1. Control the car with keyboard inputs. 
2. Compose tracks with a block-building like manner. 
3. Lane width, length, number of lane, and the number of segments can also be modified. 
4. Obtainable features are
  * Lane deviate distance / degree
  * Distances from the closest right, center, and left cars
  * Geodesic distance from the start lane
  * Which lane and segment the current car is located at.
