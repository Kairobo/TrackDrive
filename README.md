# Track Driving Simulator in MATLAB
 * This simulator is intended for developing algorithms for autonomous cars. 
 * It was used for implementing an imitation learning algorithm called [density matching reward learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.03694).

## Main Features
1. Control a car with keyboard inputs. 
2. Compose tracks with a block-building like manner. 
3. Obtainable features are
  * Lane deviate distance / degree
  * Distances from the closest right, center, and left cars
  * Geodesic distance from the start lane
  * Which lane and segment the current car is located at.
